Currenlty, I have instructions to run nlop on
Linux and Mac only. For Windows, please
install Ubuntu via virtual machine. See “Lec
0: Installation” at tiny.cc/mujoco on how to
do this.
Instructions for Mac/Linux
1) Download the latest version, https://
nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#downloadand-installation
2) Unzip in a suitable location. Say
Documents.
3) In terminal navigate to the folder and
type
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

Also see: https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/
latest/NLopt_Installation/
4) Navigate to this folder or the folder with
tutorial.c.
gcc tutorial.c -o tutorial -w -lnlopt -lm
./tutorial
If nlopt was successful you will see the
output
found minimum at f(0.333333,0.296296) =
0.5443310474
You are all set
5) The file constrained.c shows a more
generic example. We will reuse this code
when we develop code in MuJoCo
gcc constrained.c -o constrained -w -lnlopt
-lm
./constrained

If this runs fine you would see the output
found minimum at
f(1.77378,1.77354,1.45269,-0.110295,4.959
45e-05) = 8.414180297
