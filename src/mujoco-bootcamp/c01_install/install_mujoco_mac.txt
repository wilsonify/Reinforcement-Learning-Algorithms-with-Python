1) Download mujoco200_macos from https://roboti.us/
download.html. Unzip the file and drop it in Documents
2) Download the license file from https://roboti.us/file/
mjkey.txt. Drop it in the bin folder inside mujoco in the
previous step
3) Check if you have gcc/make installed. In terminal type
make —version and gcc —version (— is two hypens). If
you get the version number, you are all set. Else, install
xcode. In terminal type >> xcode-select —install and click
“install when prompted.
4) In terminal, navigate to the sample folder. Then type
>>make
In terminal, navigate to the bin folder. Then type >>./
simulate ../model/arm26.xml
If everything worked fine then you should see a GUI open
up and an arm moving. You are all set.

5) In mujoco we will edit xml (model files) (see folder
model) and write C code (see folder sample). A good
editor will help write both files. I suggest downloading and
installing Atom, https://atom.io/
Known problems
- Typing ./simulate ../model/arm26.xml first time might give
an error that the files are from an unknown developer. If
this is the case, navigate to Settings > Security & Privacy

> General. You should see the file as an app that needs to
be approved.
