Installing the C version of MuJoCo 2.2.1 on windows and
compiling/running code
(A) Installing MuJoCo and loading a model file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A1) Navigate to https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/
releases
and download the windows installation, mujoco-2.2.1windows-x86_64.zip

Unzip this file and put it in a good location (e.g.,
Documents)
A2) Navigate to bin folder and double click “simulate”. This
will open up a GUI.
A3) To load a model, go to the model folder and drop an
xml, say humanoid.xml onto the open window. If
everything worked fine, you should see a humanoid in the
window
(B) Compiling the C programs provided by Deepmind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
B1) Assuming you have done A1) above
B2) Download the Visual Studio Installer (select
community version) here: https://
visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
Once the installer has downloaded, run it. When prompted

to choose programs, choose the one that says “Desktop
development with C++” (see screenshot below). Please
restart your computer after installation.

B3) Now we will get some additional libraries to compile
and create executables for mujoco on windows. Go to
https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases and download the
latex version for Windows (usually
glfw-3.x.x.bin.WIN64.zip). Unzip the file.
Now we will drag and drop some files from the glfw folder
to mujoco
i) Copy the entire `include/GLFW` subdirectory to `mujoco/
include/GLFW`.
ii) Copy glfw3dll.lib from the subdirectory corresponding
into your compiler (here the compiler is lib-vc2022) to
`mujoco/lib/glfw3dll.lib`.
iii) Copy glfw3.dll from the subdirectory corresponding into
your compiler (here the compiler is lib-vc2022) to `mujoco/
bin/glfw3.dll`.

B4) We will open the x64 shell to compile and run
MuJoCo. Go to: Start (bottom left corner) —> Visual studio
—> x64_Native Tools Command Prompt. (see screenshot
below)

From this shell navigate to the sample folder. Then type
make.
B5) Navigage to bin folder. (cd .. followed by cd bin). Then
type simulate. Now you can do A3) above
C. Writing your own programs and running them
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
C1) Download the template_mujoco221_win.zip.
C2) In mujoco-2.2.1 make a new folder called my_project.
Unzip the template_mujoco221_win.zip.
C3) Copy the two dlls in the bin folder. They are mujoco.dll
and glfw3.dll and paste them in C:\Windows\System32
C4) In terminal navigate to template file. Type run_win and
you should see a window opens and a cube falls on the
floor.
C5) See the file how_to_use_template on how to use the
template to develop your own code.
