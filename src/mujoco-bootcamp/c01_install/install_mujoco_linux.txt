1) Download mujoco200_linux from https://roboti.us/
download.html. Unzip the file and drop it in Documents
2) Download the license file from https://roboti.us/file/
mjkey.txt. Drop it in the bin folder inside mujoco in the
previous step
3) Check if you have gcc/make installed. In terminal type
make —version and gcc —version (— is two hypens). If
you get the version number, you are all set. Else, install
gcc/make. The instructions are here: https://linuxize.com/
post/how-to-install-gcc-compiler-on-ubuntu-18-04/ You
need to know the adminstrator password before you start.
In terminal type
>> sudo apt update
>> sudo apt install build-essential
4) In terminal, navigate to the sample folder. Then type
>>make
In terminal, navigate to the bin folder. Then type >>./
simulate ../model/arm26.xml
If everything worked fine then you should see a GUI open
up and an arm moving. You are all set.
5) In mujoco we will edit xml (model files) (see folder
model) and write C code (see folder sample). A good
editor will help write both files. I suggest downloading and
installing Atom, https://atom.io/
