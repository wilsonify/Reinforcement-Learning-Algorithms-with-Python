Installing the C version of MuJoCo 2.2.1 on Ubuntu and
compiling/running code
(A) Installing MuJoCo and loading a model file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A1) Navigate to https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/
releases
and download the linxu installation files, mujoco-2.2.1-linuxx86_64.tar.gz

Unzip this file and put it in a good location (e.g.,
Documents)
A2) In terminal, navigate to bin folder and then type ./
simulate. This will open up a GUI.
A3) To load a model, go to the model folder and drop an
xml, say humanoid.xml onto the open window. If
everything worked fine, you should see a humanoid in the
window
(B) Compiling the C programs provided by Deepmind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
B1) Assuming you have done A1) above
B2) In terminal type sudo apt install libglfw3-dev. (see **)
B3) In terminal navigate to mujoco-2.2.1/sample folder.
Then type make. If everything worked fine you should see
a series of executables are created. (see I below)
B5) Navigage to bin folder. (cd .. followed by cd bin). Then

type ./simulate. Now you can do A3) above
** lock error in B while installing GLFW. See https://
itsfoss.com/could-not-get-lock-error/. Stop the updates,
restart linux, and redo install.
(C) Writing your own programs and running them
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
C1) Download the template_mujoco221_linux.zip.
C2) In mujoco-2.2.1 make a new folder called my_project.
Unzip the template_mujoco221_linux.zip.
C3) In terminal type sudo -H nautilus. Enter root
password. Press Ctrl + L. In the bar type /usr/lib. Now
copy-paste the two files from mujoco/lib to /usr/lib. These
files are: libmujoco.so and libmujoco.so.2.2.1
C4) In terminal navigate to template file. Type ./run_linux
and you should see a window opens and a cube falls on
the floor. You might need to create an executable chmod
+x run_linux
C5) See the file how_to_use_template on how to use the
template to develop your own code.
