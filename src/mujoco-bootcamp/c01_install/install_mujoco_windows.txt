1) Download mujoco200_win64 from https://roboti.us/
download.html. Unzip the file and drop it in Documents
2) Download the license file from https://roboti.us/file/
mjkey.txt. Drop it in the bin folder inside mujoco in the
previous step
3) Download the Visual Studio Installer (select community
version) here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
downloads/
Once the installer has downloaded, run it. When prompted
to choose programs, choose the one that says “Desktop
development with C++” (see screenshot below). Please
restart your computer after installation.

4) We will open the x64 shell to compile and run MuJoCo.
Go to: Start (bottom left corner) —> Visual studio —>
x64_Native Tools Command Prompt. (see screenshot
below)

In this cmd shell, navigate to the sample folder. Then type
C:\mujoco_path\sample>make
In terminal, navigate to the bin folder. Then type C:
\mujoco_path\bin>simulate ../model/arm26.xml
If everything worked fine then you should see a GUI open
up and an arm moving. You are all set.
5) In mujoco we will edit xml (model files) (see folder
model) and write C code (see folder sample). A good
editor will help write both files. I suggest downloading and
installing Atom, https://atom.io/
